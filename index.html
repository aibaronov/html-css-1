    <h1>My favorite guitar players in no particular order
    </h1>

    <p>I'm not unique in saying this, but I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. During my own challenges and tribulations, something that's helped give me mental and emotional support was music. I've always loved music and wanted to learn to play an instrument for as long as I could remember. But it was when I took a vacation to California that my uncle bought me my first guitar as a gift. It was an 85 dollar acoustic guitar that we saw at a pawn shop by the beach. He saw me eyeing it and decided to purchase it for me. Learning to play guitar was definitely a challenge, but it was a fullfilling one. As I learned more about the instrument I also learned about the influential musicians that made the guitar such a powerful tool for self expression. This is a list, in no particular order of my favorite guitar players and why I think any new musician should explore their works. </p>

    <h2>David Gilmour</h2>

    <p>David Gilmour was the final push that made me decide I had to learn guitar. I remember the first time I listened to Pink Floyd's The Wall. The album is incredible and uses so many artistic mediums to convey it's concept. Gilmour's guitar work was like nothing I'd ever heard before. Every note seemed so well placed and meaningful. One of the main themes of the album was being left without a father at an early age. It was comforting to have something I could relate to. I wanted to learn music with the hopes that I too could have a tool to express how I felt. David Gilmour showed me how the guitar could be more than just a way to pick up girls or be popular popular in school; but it could also give the player a voice if used correctly.</p>
    <h2>Tony Iommi</h2>

    <p>Classic Rock wasn't prepared for the demented, gloomy acid trip that was Black Sabbath. If you compare how upbeat and feel good the majority of rock music was at the time, it's hard to believe music this dark was able to shovel through all the pop rock and succeed. Maybe that's why Black Sabbath was so successful. It was music that validated the darkness of the human psyche. Iommi's style was rooted heavily in blues but the drop tuning and murky fuzz in his tone created a dark ambience that felt like blues rock in a nightmare world. Also, Iommi was a master at creating beautiful and melodic hooks to contrast with his gritty and thundering guitar riffs.</p>
    <h2>BB King</h2>
    <IMG class = "displayed" src="BB-King.jpg" width = "400" height = "500" alt = "BB King">
    <p>What I didn't realize when I first began playing guitar is that I was drawn to guitar players that had a heavy blues influence. At the time, I didn't even know that's what that style of music was. But if something had that vibe, I found I generally enjoyed it. I remember reading about how my favorite guitar players were influenced by blues. So I decided to research the genre which is how I discovered BB King. In his prime, King had an amazing control of his instrument. I was especially amazed by his vibrato and brilliant note choice. I think he's under rated for the musical complexity of his lead playing. What's even more amazing is that his ability to compose such wonderful passages of music was mostly intuitive and didn't rely heavily on traditional music education.</p>
